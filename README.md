# adstxtcrawler
In this project I created an ads.txt crawler through the use of a docker machine that has R Selenium installed.I created this because I wanted to have a looking at the correlation between a given url having an ads.txt (a file that is a record of the publishers the digital inventory is sold on) and the relationship between the partners ( see IAB ads.txt specification)
